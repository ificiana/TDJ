# TDJ - TopDownJapanese

\[For personal use only] TDJ is a dictionary-like repository to aid learning japanese. It
uses https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/ for its entries.

## Features

* Dictionary lookup
* Searching

## Planned Features

* WYSIWYG Editing (almost there...)
* Text analyser
* Flash cards

## How to Use

Go to https://ificiana.github.io/tdj to get started!

## Why not automate the entries?

Because I am the one learning. If I didn't learn the word, it won't be here.
