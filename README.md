# TDJ - TopDownJapanese

\[For personal use only] TDJ is a dictionary-like repository to aid learning japanese. It uses https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/ for its entries.
Note: It doesn't have a proper backend (can't host servers on Github pages), so it uses JSON data files. It can be a little slow.

## Planned Features
* Dictionary lookup
* Text analyser
* History stack
* Flash cards

## How to Use

## Why not automate the entries?

Because I am the one learning. If I didn't learn the word, it won't be here.
